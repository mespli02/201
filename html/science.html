    <h3>General Overview</h3>
        <p>
        Albert Einstein came up with this theory as he stood at a train station 
        as a train passed him by. He wondered if there were two lightning strikes, 
        one at either side of him, if someone traveling in a train at the speed of 
        light would be able to differentiate the time at which they struck. This led 
        to the development of what we now know to be the Theory of Relativity.
        </p>
        <p>
        After this discovery he coined the term time dilation. This means that when 
        one object is moving at a different relative speed to another then it will 
        genuinely experience time differently. For decades though, this was merely 
        thought and there was no evidence to back it up due to a lack of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
        This was the case until around 1970 when an experiment was run. Two planes
        of the same build and speed were each given a clock. After traversing the world, 
        one travelled east and the other to the west, and being sure to travel the same 
        distance, they compared the time differential between the clocks. It was discovered
        that the clocks were about 200 nanoseconds off from each other meaning that the 
        rotation of the earth influenced the speed at which time passed! This proved 
        the theory to be true.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alas, with this evidence we aren't able to do much with this knowledge since 
        there is such a miniscule difference given the limitations of speed at which we
        can travel with the technology we possess. With this knowledge it is eye-opening
        that one day we may be able to genuinely 'save time' if we can travel at the speed
        of light (just like in Star Wars), or close to it, but until then we can only dream 
        of such a reality.

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
     <ol>All you really need to know...
         <ul>
             <li>Time is relative to both parties </li>
             <li>The speed of light (c) is always equal to 3x10^8 m/s</li>
             <li>The party that is moving will measure a distance to be shorter compared to someone standing still</li>
             <li>If the moving party is traveling close to c then they will experience time to be shorter since they perceive distance to be shorter</li>
          </ul>
     </ol>

     <h2>In Closing...</h2>
     <p>
    As you can see from this study, there are many popular research opportunities to get involved
    in today. These are things that people wouldn't have even known about 50 years ago! We live in 
    such an exciting time, so don't be afraid to get out there! You can do so much good in the world 
    by pondering on simple questions like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein did. Some of the greatest 
    minds came from the humblest of upbringings. It doesn't take a miracle to discover! Be curious.
